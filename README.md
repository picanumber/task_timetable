## Usage

The library is tested on linux, macOs and windows. 

### Scheduler

Schedulers are instances of the `CallScheduler` class, which resides in the `ttt` (task time table) namespace:

```cpp
#include "scheduler.h"

{
    bool compensate = true; // Whether to calculate the time point of task
                            // executions by adding the interval to the:
                            // true: task start / false: task finish.

    unsigned nWorkers = 1;  // Number of workers that run tasks.

    ttt::CallScheduler plan(compensate, nWorkers);
}
```

Adding a task to the scheduler is done using its `add` method:

```cpp
{
    auto myTask = []{
        ttt::Result ret{ ttt::Result::Repeat };

        if ( /*user logic*/ )
        {
            ret = ttt::Result::Finish;
        }

        return ret; // A user task returns whether to repeat or not.
    };

    auto token = plan.add(
        myTask, // User tasks are std::function<ttt::Result()>
        500ms,  // Interval for execution or repetition
        false); // Whether to immediately queue the task for execution
}
```

As shown above, the addition of a task returns a token marked `[[no_discard]]`. Tokens control the behavior of the associated task:

1. The token is __alive__     `=>` Task is allowed to run.
2. The token is __destroyed__ `=>` Tasks are prevented from running after token destruction and are removed from the scheduler.
3. The token is __detached__  `=>` Task is independent from the token state.

__To detach a token from its task__, call the `detach()` method. If there is no need to ever cancel a task, e.g. it dies with the scheduler, the following syntax can be used to ignore the token upon creation:

```cpp
plan.add(myTask, 500ms, false).detach();
// user task ^^  ^^     ^^     ^^^^^^ Dissociate the token from task execution.
//      interval ^^     ^^
// schedule immediately ^^
```

Users that don't want to use scopes and object lifetimes to control the execution of a task, i.e. let the destructor of token cancel the task, can wrap tokens in `std::optional` and explicitly trigger the cancellation of a task:

```cpp
auto token = std::optional(plan.add(myTask, 500ms, false));
//
// Let the task run for a desired amount of time.
//
token.reset(); // Triggers the token's destructor which cancels task execution.
```

### Utilities

The library is shipped with various classes that cover common scenarios.

#### Timeline

## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./main
> make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```

A convenience script `rebuild_all.sh` is provided for users that want to generate all types of build, i.e. release, sanitizers (thread & address) and debug.
